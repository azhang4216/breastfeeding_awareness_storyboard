# 4Moms Website

A project for HackDavis 2021 to raise awareness for issues new mothers face, break stigmas surrounding breastfeeding, and encourage people to support better postpartum options for new moms.

Thereâ€™s empirical evidence to show that exclusively breastfeeding a baby for their first 6 months provides both the mother and the baby the optimal amount of health benefits. but what is oftentimes overlooked, are the obstacles that some moms have to face in order to do so.

To combat this stigma and to foster a sense of inclusivity, we developed 4moms. This interactive game allows for an immersive and educational player experience. With this game, we hope to educate more of the general public on the hardships that different mothers face.

We developed this website with the specific intent to work towards goals 5 & 10 of the UN Sustainable Goals number 5 and 10. We addressed gender inequality and inequalities within nations, respectively, by fostering empathy and understanding. Only when the general public walk a mile in the shoes of marginalized and disadvantaged communities, can we begin to work towards taking down inequalities.
