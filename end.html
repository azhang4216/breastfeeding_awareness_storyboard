                        At the end of 6 months, you have raised a healthy baby who is now transitioning to solid foods. The path that you took to get this far is unique to you and you only. When all is said and done, you have given your child the best care that you could provide—love nurtures your child regardless of circumstances.

                    We hope that after experiencing early motherhood in the shoes of 4 different mothers, you have come to realize the world of differences some have to face. We urge you to think about the new moms in your life, and how their situations may impact their ability to breastfeed and care for their baby. 

                    <br><br>We hope you now have a better understanding of the choices that different moms can and cannot make. Having learned more about the difficulties that mothers have to face in order to breastfeed, consider donating to related non-profits or learning more via the Learn More button below.
